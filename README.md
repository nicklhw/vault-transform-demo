# Vault Transform Secrets Engine Demo

![Demo Architecture](assets/vault_transform_demo.svg)

- demo-ui is a simple single page application built with Spring Boot
- demo-api is a Spring Boot application that exposes a REST API for the demo-ui.
  - It calls the Vault agent to transform sensitive data and store the transformed data in MySQL
  - It uses the Spring Cloud Vault library to integrate with the Vault API, i.e. to retrieve dynamic database credentials.
- Vault agent act as a sidecar proxy here to retrieve secrets from Vault. 
  - Auto-auth is used to handle the login to Vault and the renewal of the Vault auth token. Using auto-auth removes the responsibility of managing the auth token from the client application, making it easier for application to consume Vaultâ€™s API.
  - Vault agent is optional in this case since Spring Cloud Vault library has the ability to authenticate to Vault.
- On the Vault server side 3 secrets engines are enabled: database, transform, and transit
  - The database secrets engine integrates with MySQL to generate dynamic DB credentials for the demo-app
  - The transform secrets engine is configured to use MySQL as an external token storage for tokenization

# Prerequisites
